# Plant Disease Detection 

This project aims to detect diseases in plants using the YOLOv8 model. By analyzing images or video footage of plant leaves in real-time, the system can identify common diseases affecting plants. The project utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate detection and classification of diseases, enabling prompt action to mitigate crop damage.

Features:-

1. Real-time detection: Analyze video footage or images captured by a mobile phone camera for instant disease detection.
2. YOLOv8 model: Implement the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 architecture for robust and accurate detection of plant diseases.
3. Multiple disease classification: Identify various common diseases affecting plants, facilitating targeted treatment strategies.
4. Easy-to-use interface: Simple setup and user-friendly interface for seamless integration with mobile devices.


Installation:-

Step 1: Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/Harshpandey22/Plant-Disease-Detection

Step 2: Install dependenices: 
        cd plant-disease-detection 
        pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage:- 

1. Ensure your mobile phone is connected to the same network as your development environment.
2. Run the detection script:
       python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4

Output of the predicted Diseases can be viewed from your respective mobile phone.
